Tic Tac Toe is about as simple as board games get, and yet it’s still so fun! We wanted to share a discord bot that can be added to any server to keep the fun and our love of Tic Tac Toe alive.

**What it does**
The Tic Tac Toe Discord bot lets you pair up with a friend to play tic tac toe! Currently the bot features 5 commands, including new, quit, play, recap, and help. “New” creates a new game with another player, “quit” deletes the game, “recap” shows you the game board, and “help” is intentionally designed to be unhelpful.

## Inspiration
Tic Tac Toe is about as simple as board games get, and yet it’s still so fun! We wanted to share a discord bot that can be added to any server to keep the fun and our love of Tic Tac Toe alive.

## What it does
The Tic Tac Toe Discord bot lets you pair up with a friend to play tic tac toe! Currently the bot features 5 commands, including new, quit, play, recap, and help. “New” creates a new game with another player, “quit” deletes the game, “recap” shows you the game board, and “help” is intentionally designed to be unhelpful. 

## How we built it
We built our Tic Tac Toe Discord bot using *Node.js* to host the server and *Discord.js* to handle all requests coming  from Discord. We hosted the bot on *Repl.it*. 

## What's next for Tic Tac Toe Discord Bot
Tic Tac Toe shouldn’t be the end of the list of board games for our discord bot. Chess, Checkers, and even Backgammon can be added to it, with cute ascii art to go along.
